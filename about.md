 * Check if you're missing episodes in your collection
 * Tell you how long until the next time a show airs
 * Monitor your library of folders for new shows and seasons
 * Monitor your download directories for new files
 * Copy files from where you download them to, to fill in gaps in your main collection
 * Un-name files, using names in a .torrent file
