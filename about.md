## What TVRename isn't...
OK, before we get into all the really cool stuff TVRename can do let's get what it doesn't do out the way...

**TVRename does NOT download TV Shows**

(But it can help you find TV Shows to download!)

## What TVRename is...
On the surface TVRename will "fix" the names of downloaded TV Show files: -

Say you've downloaded a few TV Show episodes, and they have names like:

>  *Grey's.Anatomy.S03E04.blah.xvid.avi*

and you want them named like:

> *Greys Anatomy - S03E04 - What I Am.avi*

...then this is the tool for you!

## But wait.. Theres more!!!
 * Rename files, using data from [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com "Visit thetvdb.com") using configurable rules
 * Check if you're missing TV Show episodes in your collection
 * Tell you how long until the next episode of a TV Show airs
 * Monitor your media library for new episodes and seasons of shows
 * Monitor your download directories for new files
 * Copy (or move) files from your download directories (and other locations) to your media library
 * Create web searches to help find missing files in shows
 * Restore filenames to those originally found in a .torrent files

To do all this clever stuff TVRename makes extensive use of data from [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com "Visit thetvdb.com"), without their database and API this tool would not exist!

 **PLEASE SUPPORT THEM IN ANY WAY YOU CAN!**
