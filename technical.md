TVRename makes use of data from [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com/). Please visit their site, and consider helping by contributing information and artwork for episodes and series. It also uses [DotNET Zip](http://www.codeplex.com/DotNetZip), [SourceGrid](http://www.codeplex.com/sourcegrid/), and has had significant speed improvements as a result of using Red Gate's [ANTS profiler](http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_profiler/index.htm), and JetBrains' [dotTrace](http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/). JetBrains' [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) is also used for improving the code.
