TVRename makes use of data from TheTVDB.com. Please visit their site, and consider helping by contributing information and artwork for episodes and series. It also uses DotNET Zip, SourceGrid, and has had significant speed improvements as a result of using Red Gate's ANTS profiler, and JetBrains' dotTrace. JetBrains' ReSharper is also used for improving the code.
