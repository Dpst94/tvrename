##### Welcome to 
#### TV&nbsp;Rename
***The tool that helps you organise your TV Show Collection with ease...***

## What is TV Rename?
TV Rename is a media management tool that runs on Windows XP and later, looking after all your TV Show files and making them presentable for Kodi (XBMC), Mede8er, pyTivo and other media hubs.

On the surface TV Rename will "fix" the names of TV Show files...

Say you've got a few TV Show episodes saved as video files, they will probably have names like this: -

> ***Grey's.Anatomy.S03E04.blah-blah.xvid.avi***

But you want them automatically renamed including the show and episode name and the season and episode number like this: -

> ***Grey's Anatomy - S03E04 - What I Am.avi***

...this is the tool for you!

## But wait... There's more!
**TV Rename can: -**
* Rename files, using data from [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com") and rules you can configure
* Monitor specified folders for TV Show files

> ***"Media Library"*** - *a folder (or folders) somewhere on your PC or NAS or whatever, with a bunch of TV Show files in it (them).*

**Once TV Rename knows about your Media Library it can: -**
* Copy (or move) files from monitored folders to your Media Library
* List any missing TV Show episodes/seasons in your Media Library
* Create web searches to help you find missing TV Show files
* Tell you how long you'll have to wait until the next episode of your current favourite TV Show airs
