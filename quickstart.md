# Quickstart Guide
***Welcome to TVRename!***

This guide will help you to quickly get TVRename up and running.

This page can always be accessed by going to the TVRename Help menu, and choosing "Quickstart Guide".

(This guide assumes that you already have the beginings of a "Media Library" - *a directory somewhere on your PC or a NAS or whatever, with a bunch of recordings in it*.)

Lets get started...

**Setup Steps**
1. **Add content from your "Media Library".**
 * Go to **Tools>Folder Monitor** and whilst on the *Folder* tab click the **\[ Add \]** button. Browse to the root directory of your "Media Library" and click **\[ OK \]**. The path will be added to the *Monitor Folders* list.
 * Click the **\[ Check >> \]** button, the selected path will be scanned and the found content automatically displayed in the *Scan Results* tab.
 * Whilst displaying the *Scan Results* tab click the **\[ Auto ID All \]** button and TVRename will attempt to match the found information against the TVDB (http://thetvdb.com), and try to guess if the shows found in the library have a "flat" structure with all the shows episodes in one folder, or a "tree" structure with sub folders for each season and specials.
 Any shows not identified will not have an entry in the **Show** column or the **thetvdb code** column; these can be fixed manually by highlighting the relevant row in the table and clicking **\[ Edit \]** and searching again.
 * Once the match process has finished, click **\[ Add & Close \]** and all the identified folders/shows will be added to the *My Shows* tab. *My Shows* should now be populated with the TV shows that have been found.
 * You can manually add individual shows (even if they don't have a specific folder) by clicking the **\[ Add \]** button at the bottom of the *My Shows* tab. Enter the show name, and click **\[ Search \]** to find it. Enter the base folder for the show in your media library, and select whether or not you have a sub-folder for each season.
 * Go back to the *My Shows* tab and browse the series information for your shows. Here you can edit the show itself to control how TVRename manages it, or edit a season to override episode information fetched from TheTVDB.

2. **Set your Preferences**
 * In **Options>Preferences**, go to the *Search Folders* tab and set the download location for new episodes. Also visit **Options>Filename Template Editor** to set how TVRename will rename your files.

1. Go through the preferences and settings to make are things are how you want them

**Initial Scan**

5. Go to the **"Scan"** tab, and click "Full Scan". TVRename will download any show information needed from TheTVDB, and check your media library. You can control what actions will be performed by clicking "Options..." before doing a scan.

6. After a scan, review the suggested changes and other information. Any ticked item will be actioned, so untick things you aren't sure about, or use the checkboxes in the bottom-right of the screen. Right-click on selected items for more actions.

7. Click **"Do Checked"** at the bottom of the Scan tab to have TVRename perform the ticked actions. It will move, rename, download, etc. as necessary.

**Ongoing Monitoring**

8. Go to the **"When to watch"** tab to see all known future airdates of shows you are interested in.

9. Link TV Rename to your **download folders** and setup the auto-scan funciton. This will mean that TV Rename will automatically scan whenever a new file is made available .

4. Sit back and let TV Rename do all the hard work for you!

Whatever manipulation TVRename does to your files, it will never change the season or episode number. If the names get screwed up, the season and episode number will be unchanged. This means that the problem should be (fairly easily) fixable after changing some settings, or adding new rules.
