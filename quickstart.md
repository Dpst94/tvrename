# Quickstart Guide
*Welcome to TVRename!*

This guide will help you get TVRename up and running in the shortest possible time.
This page can always be accessed by going to the TVRename Help menu, and choosing "Quickstart Guide".

(This guide assumes that you already have the beginings of a "Media Library" ***read:** a directory somewhere on your PC or a NAS or whatever*, with a bunch of recordings in it.)

Lets get started...

**Setup**

1. Go to **Tools>Folder Monitor**. This will let you add a lot of folders quickly, and semi-automatically. After setting where the base of your media library is, tell it to "Check", then do a "Auto ID All". TVRename will scan your media library, and match up show names against TheTVDB, and also guess if you have a "flat" structure with all your seasons in one folder, or separated out. When finished, click "Add & Close" to add all identified folders to "My Shows".

1.  You can **manually add shows** one-by-one (even if they don't have a folder on disk somewhere) by clicking the "Add" button at the bottom of the "My Shows" tab. Enter the show name, and click search to find it's ID code. Enter the base folder for the show in your media library, and select whether or not you have a sub-folder for each season.

**Preferences**

3. Go to the **"My Shows"** tab and browse the series and episode information for your shows. You can edit the show itself to control how TVRename manages that particular show, or edit a season to override the episode information fetched from TheTVDB.

4. In Options>Preferences, go to **"Search Folders"** and set where you download new episodes to. Also visit Options>Filename Template Editor to set how TVRename will rename your files.

1. Go through the preferences and settings to make are things are how you want them

**Initial Scan**

5. Go to the **"Scan"** tab, and click "Full Scan". TVRename will download any show information needed from TheTVDB, and check your media library. You can control what actions will be performed by clicking "Options..." before doing a scan.

6. After a scan, review the suggested changes and other information. Any ticked item will be actioned, so untick things you aren't sure about, or use the checkboxes in the bottom-right of the screen. Right-click on selected items for more actions.

7. Click **"Do Checked"** at the bottom of the Scan tab to have TVRename perform the ticked actions. It will move, rename, download, etc. as necessary.

**Ongoing Monitoring**

8. Go to the **"When to watch"** tab to see all known future airdates of shows you are interested in.

9. Link TV Rename to your **download folders** and setup the auto-scan funciton. This will mean that TV Rename will automatically scan whenever a new file is made available .

4. Sit back and let TV Rename do all the hard work for you!

Whatever manipulation TVRename does to your files, it will never change the season or episode number. If the names get screwed up, the season and episode number will be unchanged. This means that the problem should be (fairly easily) fixable after changing some settings, or adding new rules.
