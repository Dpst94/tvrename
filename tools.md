## Exporters
"RSS Export" will save a RSS-reader compatible XML file to the location you specify. It can then be read by something like XBOX Media Center, or the Vista RSS Widget. You can limit how many days or shows are written to the file. The RSS file is updated whenever the "When to watch" tab is manually or automatically refreshed.

Below is an example of the RSS output being displayed in a Vista sidebar gadget. Clicking on each item shows the episode summary information.
